# Safari Park

A brand new safari park has opened in the area and they need you to help manage things! They need a database that will store staff details and ultimately keep track of who is looking after each animal.

You will need to design the database before writing a Python application to enable to park manager to interact with it.

## Things to Remember...

- Draw out your database and class diagrams before you start coding each stage.
- You can create a `console.py` file to test your database methods in.
- You may find it useful to make a `delete_all()` method to clear your database when you run the console file.
- You'll need a `run_sql.py` file. It's fine to copy/paste this, but remember to update it!

## MVP

- Add a member of staff
- List all staff
- Find a specific member of staff
- Remove a member of staff
- Update a member of staff

Staff members should have a name, start date (this can be a string for now), department and a performance rating from 1-5.

## Extensions

- Modify the database to include animals in the park. They'll need a name and a type, and many animals can be looked after by the same keeper.
- Add functionality to add animals, list all animals and find a specific animal.
- The manager needs to be get a list of all animals being looked after by a given member of staff.

## Further Extensions

- Find the member of staff looking after a given animal.
- Add functionality for updating and deleting animals.
- Investigate a more appropriate type for the staff start date.
